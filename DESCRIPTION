Description: Quantfuse provides methods for retail traders to augment their strategies with quantitative 
    analytics and financial data visualization. Quantfuse allows traders to enhance
    their existing portfolio management software by providing an improved interface
    to equity, cryptocurrency, and derivatives markets. The package combines 
    auth-based functionality and quantitative analytics to boost the capabilities 
    of two popular exchanges: Robinhood and Coinbase. Collectively, with various 
    front-end's built in shiny, quantfuse allows traders to build machine learning 
    algorithms and quantitative models while removing the time-consuming task of
    developing from scratch.
